The problem for Advent of Code Day 16 is we are given a ticket with fields we can't understand and values for those fields:

e.g, An example ticket:

```
.--------------------------------------------------------.
| ????: 101    ?????: 102   ??????????: 103     ???: 104 |
|                                                        |
| ??: 301  ??: 302             ???????: 303      ??????? |
| ??: 401  ??: 402           ???? ????: 403    ????????? |
'--------------------------------------------------------'
```

And some rules for the fields on the ticket:

```
class: 0-1 or 4-19
row: 0-5 or 8-19
seat: 0-13 or 16-19
```

We also get given our ticket, and some nearby tickets:

```
your ticket:                                                                                             
11,12,13                                                                                                 
                                                                                                         
nearby tickets:                                                                                          
3,9,18                                                                                                   
15,1,5                                                                                                   
6,9,87                                                                                                   
5,14,9                                                                                                   
11,3,22  
```

We have to filter out invalid tickets, then use the remaining tickets to determine which fields is which in our ticket based on the rules.

For the example input the invalid tickets would be:                                                      

```
6,9,87                                                                                                   
11,3,22                                                                                                  
```                                                                                                      
That leaves:                                                                                             

```                                                                                                      
3,9,18                                                                                                   
15,1,5                                                                                                   
5,14,9   
```

From this we can determine the fields:

```
tickets  |   3  |   9  |  18   |                                                                         
         |  15  |   1  |   5   |                                                                         
         |   5  |  14  |   9   |                                                                         
         |---------------------|                                                                         
possible | row | row   | row   |                                                                         
fields   |     | class | class |                                                                         
         |     |       | seat  |  
```

So the first value in a ticket has to be "row"
The second value in a ticket has to be "class"
The third value in a ticket has to be "seat"

This logic needs implementing for the much larger actual puzzle input.    

#Filtering out invalid tickets

This is just parsing the ranges and finding tickets that contain fields which can't be placed into any o\
f the ranges.
